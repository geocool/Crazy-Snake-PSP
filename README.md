#### About this repository  
I created Crazy Snake PSP in 2011 in C language.  
I had only a week to created this game so it's not the best example of code  
but it can be valuable for some people that want to create a psp homebrew.  

#### Game Information
Crazy Snake is a clone of the classic snake game that first introduced in Nokia phones.  
Move snake around and drive it straight to his food so you can gain points.  
There are 5 Levels and a X Level Mode that starts from level 1 and changes level over points.  
Higher Level Means More Points !
